# ESP32-S3-CO2-Monitor
This is the wall charger mount version of the co2 monitor has been slowly evolving for a while.
It started out as a sensor on qwiic connector but was too messy

The next version elinated the cable. Because of the height of the sensor this version puts it on a seperate board and rear mounts it. From the front side all you see is the tiny hole. It requires a usb-c cable that is on the side and can sit on your desk
